# Hangman_in_python
 
Hello coders!

Today, I have created a console based Hangman game. Here a word is randomly chosen from the list and you have to guess the word.
Furthermore, if you want the rough idea of the whole project, then you can get it from outline.txt, and therequired modules are added in requirements.txt file.

Enjoy.......

If there is any problem in the code or you want to give your suggestion for the code then you can contact me by email maharshichokshi2003@gmail.com
